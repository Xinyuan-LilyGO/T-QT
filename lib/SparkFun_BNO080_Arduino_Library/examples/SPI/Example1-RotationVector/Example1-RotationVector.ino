  This example shows how to use the SPI interface on the BNO080. It's fairly involved
  and requires 7 comm wires (plus 2 power), soldering the PS1 jumper, and clearing
  the I2C jumper. We recommend using the Qwiic I2C interface, but if you need speed
  SPI is the way to go.

  This example shows how to output the i/j/k/real parts of the rotation vector.

  Hardware modifications:
  The PS1 jumper must be closed.
  The PS0 jumper must be open. PS0/WAKE is connected and the WAK pin is used to bring the IC out of sleep.
  The I2C pull up jumper must be cleared/open.
  The ADR jumper must be cleared/open. 

  Hardware Connections:
  Don't hook the BNO080 to a normal 5V Uno! Either use the Qwiic system or use a
  microcontroller that runs at 3.3V.
  Arduino 13 = BNO080 SCK
  12 = SO
  11 = SI
  10 = !CS
  9 = WAK
  8 = !INT
  7 = !RST
  3.3V = 3V3
  GND = GND
