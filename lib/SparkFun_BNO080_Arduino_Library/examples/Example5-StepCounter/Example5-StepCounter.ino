  This example shows the step count. Tap the IC a few times to emulate a step.

  It takes about 1ms at 400kHz I2C to read a record from the sensor, but we are polling the sensor continually
  between updates from the sensor. Use the interrupt pin on the BNO080 breakout to avoid polling.

  Hardware Connections:
  Attach the Qwiic Shield to your Arduino/Photon/ESP32 or other
  Plug the sensor onto the shield
  Serial.print it out at 115200 baud to serial monitor.
